This is a sample showing the balance and transactions of an address.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Potential improvements

- Add USD values. Could be done with defillama and displayed.
- Add more fields to the transactions like Etherscan shows such as gas price, block, fees, etc.
